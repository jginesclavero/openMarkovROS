## Abstract
Social robots deployed in real-world scenarios experiment different changes, activities, and progresses of internal and circumstances. These circumstances generate several sources of information that can be used for improving the decision-making process of the robot using Bayesian Networks. This research aims to generalize and take advantage of this information using Conceptual Graphs. The Conceptual Graph formalizes the knowledge database and their relations, and this particular article exploits the context awareness for enhancing the knowledge about the robot environment at symbolic level adapting it for feeding a PDDL-based planner.
